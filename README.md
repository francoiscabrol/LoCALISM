LoCALISM - Leap CALIbration SysteM
==============

A mouse replacement system using leap motion based on a screen calibration tool.
--------------

*Written in Java*

  * Root package: com.cabrol.francois.localism
  * Dependence: LeapJava.jar (leap motion library for Java)


The idea is to create a screen calibration system. I'd like to get localism work better and transform it in a simple screen calibration library.
