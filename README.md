LoCALISM - Leap CALIbration SysteM
==============

A mouse replacement system using leap motion and based on a screen calibration tool.
--------------

The first idea was to create a mouse replacement system based on an home-made screen calibration system.
Now, I'd like to get localism work better and transform it in a simple screen calibration library for the leap Motion.

*Written in Java*

  * Calibration system: com.cabrol.francois.localism.calibration
  * Example: com.cabrol.francois.localism.example
  * Dependence: LeapJava.jar (leap motion library for Java)


* The version 0.1.0 is the first release that show how the system could works.
* The version 0.2.0 will be a refactoring that allows to use the calibration system as library easily in any java project.
