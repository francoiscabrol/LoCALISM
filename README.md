LoCALISM - Leap CALIbration SysteM
==============

A mouse replacement system using leap motion and based on a screen calibration tool.
--------------

The idea is to create a screen calibration system. I'd like to get localism work better and transform it in a simple screen calibration library for the leap Motion.

*Written in Java*

  * Calibration system: com.cabrol.francois.localism.calibration
  * Example: com.cabrol.francois.localism.example
  * Dependence: LeapJava.jar (leap motion library for Java)
